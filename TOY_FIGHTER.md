TOY FIGHTER

P+K is Throw, it does 2 lifebars, if you tech in the blue window you are
safe, in the red window it attempts a reversal... THESE ARE KEY

1) PICK CYMBALS

2) 4PP is the Neutral Winner, if opponent refuses to get thrown, slap em

3) D is the "Dodge" button, it will autododge strikes without particle effects
    if you're grabbed while dodging, the tech window is tiny, watch out

4) with Cymbals 9PP (must only press twice quickly, but not three times
   think like a Mortal Kombat dial-a-combo) and then link P+K+D (super)
   (you need to wait for full recovery of 9PP) this makes the super come out
   with no charge time, it is a running command grab, that does *3 LIFE BARS*

5) Also it OTGs

6) sometimes it catches rolling as a prank

7) no really throw into super cancel you take the round

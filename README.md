THE RUMBLE FISH 2

AIR TECH BUTTONS EXISTS!!!!

1) Pick Mito

2) 236PP 623PP for Stance Change Fireball/DP

3) in Stance Change 214LP/HP for multi hit jump in
Short hop normal that's often a L/R 50/50, all hits
are overhead, can cancel out of crLK->crHK

4) Her j.HK in stance change is also nonsense

5) LK+HP/LP+HK is 
Chain Shift+ Soul Satellite for one of each bar

4) IF NEEDED THROW IS 6HP/4HP

5) Supers are 236236P

6) 214HP steals the corner

PLAN B

1) Pick Bazoo

2) 22P or 236LP  to make a rock, you can hold
 rock comes out on negative edge

3)sweep knockdown->setup rock->Both Lights is unblockable attack

4) Charge Back->Forward HK is heehoo plus on block and leaves big range
for big normals

5) 236236P is invuln but stubby 


TOY FIGHTER


P+K is Throw, it does 2 lifebars, if you tech in the blue window you are
safe, in the red window it attempts a reversal... THESE ARE KEY

1) PICK CYMBALS

2) 4PP is the Neutral Winner, if opponent refuses to get thrown, slap em

3) D is the "Dodge" button, it will autododge strikes without particle effects
    if you're grabbed while dodging, the tech window is tiny, watch out

4) with Cymbals 9PP (must only press twice quickly, but not three times
   think like a Mortal Kombat dial-a-combo) and then link P+K+D (super)
   (you need to wait for full recovery of 9PP) this makes the super come out
   with no charge time, it is a running command grab, that does *3 LIFE BARS*

5) Also it OTGs

6) sometimes it catches rolling as a prank

7) no really throw into super cancel you take the round

Kizuna Encounter Super Tag

1) Pick King Lion

2)6A+B is a dodge forward, invuln
 passes through other player, DOESNT steal corner

3) You can only Tag (D button) in you TAG ZONE
(it is painted on the ground) character in back
heals VERY SLOWLY don't bank on it, but don't die
with an extra lifebar in the back

4) with King Lion 6C is a 2 hit normal, crazy
    6C->623A->236C is a ton of damage

5) when lifebars are in red+flashing, you have
 access to desperation super (641236A/HCB->F A)

6)  King Lion Super is HEAD ASS, JUST DO IT
1000000 DAMAGE 2 HITS LASER ALL BUSINESS

7) good 2nd characters: 
TIE: Eagle is a solid ryu, 
214C is nutso fireball 623B crazy good DP, 
super a lil ass.

MATT: Joker, teleport that hits overhead (214B)
 blows up projectiles,  623C jack in the box anti-air
safe, cracks the sky, maybe plus???
